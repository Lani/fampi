# Markdown
I really need to learn this. Some resources that could help on that:

* Official site: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
* Cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

# Validation
### ecmamodel
Intresting syntax

# Dependency Injection
I will not continue to look into DI frameworks at the moment. Will use 
vanilla node/javascript to begin with.

## Why it's needed

## Existing Solutions
### Aurelia DI
States that it can be used on the server side.

Some useful(?) resources:
http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/dependency-injection/latest/dependency-injection-basics
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34793723/assisted-injection-in-aurelia

### dependency-injection-es6
Looks promising, but new, fairly inactive and no community
https://github.com/mench/dependency-injection-es6

### InversifyJS

### Scatter
Outdated docs? Not much activity.
